## Description
This is a very basic sample app with a very limited feature set of allowing users to search through movies.
Users are able to search movies based on title and paginate through the results.

This app is built using [The Movie Database](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to provide search results.

Tech Involved: React, MobX.

## Challenges & Decisions
Main challenge was constructing something that looks somewhat decent. While I try to be somewhat informed about design, it is definitely not my forte.
Main logic is in the MoviesStore. I try to follow the smart/dumb component guidelines when constructing components, so the main connected component is only App.

## Improvements
- TESTING!!!
- Mobile Responsive
- Better Pagination
- Error Handling
- Design for No Results state
- No image drool
- Should be able to click into movies to get more details
